Name: rangebar
Description: The RangeBar Renderer draws a vertical bar between two data
             values, and an optional outline around the bars.
Options:

    OPTION NAME:          barwidth
    DESCRIPTION:          Width, in relative terms to the type of the
                          axis the plot is on, of the bars.
    ACCEPTED VALUE:       DataMeasure
    DEFAULT VALUE:        none
                          
    OPTION NAME:          baroffset
    DESCRIPTION:          The offset of the left edge of each bar
                          from the corresponding data value, as a
                          fraction (0-1) of the barwidth.
    ACCEPTED VALUE:       number
    DEFAULT VALUE:        0

    OPTION NAME:          fillcolor
    DESCRIPTION:          Color used for filling the bars.
    ACCEPTED VALUE:       color
    DEFAULT VALUE:        0x808080 (dark gray)

    OPTION NAME:          fillopacity
    DESCRIPTION:          The opactiy of the fill area, in the range 0-1.
                          A value of 1 means completely opaque; a value of 0
                          means completely invisible.
    ACCEPTED VALUE:       number
    DEFAULT VALUE:        1

    OPTION NAME:          linecolor
    DESCRIPTION:          Color used for outlines around the bars.
    ACCEPTED VALUE:       color
    DEFAULT VALUE:        0x000000 (black)

    OPTION NAME:          linewidth
    DESCRIPTION:          Width, in pixels, of outlines around
                          the bars.  A value of 0 (which is the
                          default) means don't draw outlines.
    ACCEPTED VALUE:       number
    DEFAULT VALUE:        0

    OPTION NAME:          hidelines
    DESCRIPTION:          Bars which are less wide, in pixels, than
                          this number do not render their outlines.
    ACCEPTED VALUE:       number
    DEFAULT VALUE:        2

---

Data Types:

     DataValue:

        Either a number or a datetime string.

        With DataValues, a datetime string may be specified in the
        17-character format YYYYMMDDHHmmssqqq, in which the letters
        have the following meanings:

        Component   Meaning 
        YYYY        4-digit year
        MM          2-digit month (01--12)
        DD          2-digit day of month (01--31)
        HH          2-digit hour of day (00--23)
        mm          2-digit minutes (00--59)
        ss          2-digit seconds (00--59), or decimal seconds with millisecond precision
        qqq         3-digit milliseconds (000--999; should only be present if ss does not contain a decimal)

        Any number of these components may be omitted from the
        right-hand end of the string (except the year YYYY, which is
        always required), in which case the missing components are
        assumed to be zero (except MM or DD, which default to 01).

     DataMeasure:
        
        Specifies the width of an area relative to the datatype of its
        axis. Either a number or a datetime string.

        With DataMeasures, a datetime string may be specified in the
        format [NUMBER][CHARACTER-CODE]; in which the brackets are not
        included, NUMBER is any number and CHARACTER-CODE is one of the
        following:

        Code   Meaning 
        Y      years
        M      months
        W      weeks
        D      days
        H      hours
        m      minutes
        s      seconds
        ms     milliseconds
  
     color:

        A color expressed as either a 6 digit hex code or one of the
        following strings:

        black
        red
        green
        blue
        yellow
        magenta
        cyan
        white
