Data Types:

     DataValue:

        Either a number or a datetime string.

        With DataValues, a datetime string may be specified in the
        17-character format YYYYMMDDHHmmssqqq, in which the letters
        have the following meanings:

        Component   Meaning 
        YYYY        4-digit year
        MM          2-digit month (01--12)
        DD          2-digit day of month (01--31)
        HH          2-digit hour of day (00--23)
        mm          2-digit minutes (00--59)
        ss          2-digit seconds (00--59), or decimal seconds with millisecond precision
        qqq         3-digit milliseconds (000--999; should only be present if ss does not contain a decimal)

        Any number of these components may be omitted from the
        right-hand end of the string (except the year YYYY, which is
        always required), in which case the missing components are
        assumed to be zero (except MM or DD, which default to 01).

     DataMeasure:
        
        Specifies the width of an area relative to the datatype of its
        axis. Either a number or a datetime string.

        With DataMeasures, a datetime string may be specified in the
        format [NUMBER][CHARACTER-CODE]; in which the brackets are not
        included, NUMBER is any number and CHARACTER-CODE is one of the
        following:

        Code   Meaning 
        Y      years
        M      months
        W      weeks
        D      days
        H      hours
        m      minutes
        s      seconds
        ms     milliseconds
  
     color:

        A color expressed as either a 6 digit hex code or one of the
        following strings:

        black
        red
        green
        blue
        yellow
        magenta
        cyan
        white
